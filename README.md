Purpose of this project is to analyze/visualize the google analytics data from my personal website: bidamia.ca

The data will be visualized using R Shiny, hosted on AWS and using EC2 for storage.

You can view the wireframe of the dashboard [here](https://github.com/chrisselig/google_analytics/blob/master/00_wireframe/dashboard_wireframe.pdf)
